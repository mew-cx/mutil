Mutil Installation
==================

1. Prerequisites

    o GNU coreutils 7.6

        The Mutil patch is only applicable against coreutils 7.6.

    o Compiler with OpenMP support

        For example, the GNU C Compiler >= 4.2 or Intel C Compiler >= 9.1.
        Tested with gcc 4.4.4 and icc 10.1/11.1.

    o GNU TLS library (optional but required for multi-node TCP support)

        Tested with gnutls 2.8.6.

    o Libgcrypt library (optional but required for hashing support)

        Note that msum is not functional without this, but mcp is still
        usable.  Tested with libgcrypt 1.4.5.

    o Libgpg-error library (optional but required for hashing support)

        Note that you must configure with --enable-static to ensure that
        the static version of this library exists.  Tested with
        libgpg-error 1.7.

    o MPI library (optional but required for multi-node MPI support)

        Tested with SGI Message Passing Toolkit 1.25/1.26.


2. Installation

    Note that while coreutils compiles on many types of systems, Mutil
    has only been tested on Linux.  It is unknown if it will compile
    and/or operate properly on other types of systems.

    2.1. Preparation

        2.1.1. New Installation

            Mutil is created by applying the "coreutils-7.6" patch to an
            unpacked coreutils 7.6 distribution.  This is done via the
            "patch" command:

                cd coreutils-7.6
                patch -p1 < /path/to/patch/coreutils-7.6.patch

            The output should be similar to the following:

                patching file COPYING
                patching file Makefile.in
                patching file aclocal.m4
                patching file configure
                patching file doc/Makefile.in
                patching file gnulib-tests/Makefile.in
                patching file lib/Makefile.in
                patching file lib/config.hin
                patching file lib/isnan.c
                patching file m4/gnulib-comp.m4
                patching file m4/mcore.m4
                patching file man/Makefile.in
                patching file man/cp.1
                patching file man/md5sum.1
                patching file src/Makefile.am
                patching file src/Makefile.in
                patching file src/copy.c
                patching file src/copy.h
                patching file src/cp.c
                patching file src/mcore-omp.h
                patching file src/mcore.c
                patching file src/mcore.h
                patching file src/md5sum.c
                patching file tests/Makefile.in

        2.1.2. Upgrade Installation

            If you have previously patched coreutils 7.6 to produce
            Mutil 1.76.N, you may upgrade to 1.76.4 by applying the
            corresponding "mutil-1.76.N" patch:

                cd coreutils-7.6
                patch -p1 < /path/to/patch/mutil-1.76.N.patch

            The output should be the following for Mutil 1.76.[12]:

                patching file man/cp.1
                patching file man/md5sum.1
                patching file src/copy.c
                patching file src/copy.h
                patching file src/cp.c
                patching file src/mcore-omp.h
                patching file src/mcore.c
                patching file src/mcore.h
                patching file src/md5sum.c

            the following for Mutil 1.76.3:

                patching file src/copy.c
                patching file src/cp.c
                patching file src/md5sum.c

            the following for Mutil 1.76.4:

                patching file src/cp.c
                patching file src/md5sum.c

            and the following for Mutil 1.76.5:

                patching file src/copy.c
                patching file src/cp.c
                patching file src/md5sum.c

    2.2. Configuration

        Mutil supports auto-detection of its prerequisites through the
        normal "configure" process.  If any prerequisites are installed
        in non-standard locations, you must set CFLAGS and LDFLAGS
        before invoking configure.  For example (using sh syntax):

            export CFLAGS=-I/my/include
            export LDFLAGS=-L/my/lib

        would search for additional include files in /my/include and
        additional libraries in /my/lib.  Note that gnutls and libgcrypt
        are statically linked into the executables so need only be
        available during compilation.
        
        For OpenMP and/or MPI libraries that are in non-standard
        locations, but accessible by all users, a run-time path can be
        supplied to the linker so users do not need to set environment
        variables such as LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  For example:

            export LDFLAGS=-L/gcc/4.4.4/lib64 -lgomp -Wl,-rpath /gcc/4.4.4/lib64'

        would always search for the gcc OpenMP libraries in /gcc/4.4.4/lib64
        even if that path is not in the user's or system's environment.

        The default values of some options can be changed by adding
        additional definitions into CFLAGS.  The following settings
        may be configured at compile-time (defaults in brackets):

            DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE     [4] (MB)
            DEFAULT_DIRECT_READ     [0]
            DEFAULT_DIRECT_WRITE    [0]
            DEFAULT_DOUBLE_BUFFER   [0]
            DEFAULT_FADVISE_READ    [0]
            DEFAULT_FADVISE_WRITE   [0]
            DEFAULT_HASH_TYPE       [GCRY_MD_MD5]
            DEFAULT_SPLIT_SIZE      [0] (MB)
            DEFAULT_THREADS         [4]

        For example:

            export CFLAGS="-I/my/include -DDEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE=1"

        would set the default buffer size to 1 MB.

        Note that no validation is done on default parameters so make
        sure they conform to expected values.  Namely, the split size
        should be a non-negative integer, the buffer size and number of
        threads should be positive integers, and the direct read, direct
        write, double buffer, fadvise read, and fadvise write values
        should be 0 or 1.  The default hash type must be a Libgcrypt
        definition beginning with "GCRY_" corresponding to a supported
        hash defined in gcrypt.h.

        Also note that setting the default split size to any value
        besides zero breaks drop-in compatibility of the hashing
        functionality as files larger than this size will produce a
        sum based on a hash tree instead of a plain hash.  The benefit
        of using a non-zero split size is that performance can be
        increased dramatically on large files by default.

        Some file systems do not support direct I/O so care should be
        taken enabling it by default.  Note that if any of direct read,
        direct write, double buffer, fadvise read, or fadvise write is
        enabled by default, the corresponding command-line options will
        become --no-direct-read, --no-direct-write, --no-double-buffer,
        --no-fadvise-read, and --no-fadvise-write.

        Once the environment has been configured, run:

            ./configure

        Run "./configure --help" for additional configuration options.

    2.3. Compilation

        To compile, run:

            make

        Mutil does not rename the resulting files, so after compilation:
        
            o src/cp is the mcp executable
            o src/md5sum is the msum executable
            o man/cp.1 is the mcp man file
            o man/md5sum.1 is the msum man file

        The options listed in the man pages and when the executables are
        run with "--help" will vary depending on which prerequisites
        were available during the build process.

    2.4. Installation

        *DO NOT* run "make install".  Mutil builds only a subset of
        coreutils and may break functionality of other components.
        Install Mutil manually by copying the executables and man files
        to the appropriate directory.  For example, to install to
        "/usr/local", use:

            cp src/cp /usr/local/bin/mcp
            cp src/md5sum /usr/local/bin/msum
            cp man/cp.1 /usr/local/man/man1/mcp.1
            cp man/md5sum.1 /usr/local/man/man1/msum.1

        Note that in this example, the files have been renamed to
        mcp/msum.
